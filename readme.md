### Lisp Interpreter in JS ###

A (work in progress) Lisp interpreter for the web.

Angular on the front, Node server on the back.

Inspired by Peter Norvig's Python and Mary Rose Cook's JS interpreters.

Plus, Lisp is beautiful.

The sandbox currently only supports evaluation one line at a time (sorry!)
